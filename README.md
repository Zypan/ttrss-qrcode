ttrss-qrcode
==========

About
----------

An on-demand QR-Code generator plugin for TTRSS (http://tt-rss.org). The QR-Codes are generated through PHP and do not require any external service.

The QR-Codes are generated thanks to the [phpqrcode library](http://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net/).

Once created, any QR-Code is saved as a PNG on the server, and is cached for future serving. Make sur the "cache" subfolder of the plugin is writeable by your webserver.

This plugin has been tested on the version 18.8 of TTRSS.
